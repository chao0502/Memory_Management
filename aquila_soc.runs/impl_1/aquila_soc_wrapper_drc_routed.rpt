2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net aquila_soc_i/aquila_0/inst/aquila_core/Memory_Management/allocator/read_request_reg_0[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin aquila_soc_i/aquila_0/inst/aquila_core/Memory_Management/allocator/dmm_size_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell aquila_soc_i/aquila_0/inst/aquila_core/Memory_Management/allocator/dmm_size_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net aquila_soc_i/aquila_0/inst/aquila_core/Memory_Management/dmm_dataout_reg[255]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin aquila_soc_i/aquila_0/inst/aquila_core/Memory_Management/dmm_dataout_reg[255]_i_2/O, cell aquila_soc_i/aquila_0/inst/aquila_core/Memory_Management/dmm_dataout_reg[255]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.

PLCK-23#1 Warning
Clock Placer Checks  
Sub-optimal placement for a clock-capable IO pin and MMCM pair. 
Resolution: A dedicated routing path between the two can be used if: (a) The clock-capable IO (CCIO) is placed on a CCIO capable site (b) The MMCM is placed in the same clock region as the CCIO pin. If the IOB is driving multiple MMCMs, all MMCMs must be placed in the same clock region, one clock region above or one clock region below the IOB. Both the above conditions must be met at the same time, else it may lead to longer and less predictable clock insertion delays.
 This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	aquila_soc_i/mig_7series_0/u_aquila_soc_mig_7series_0_0_mig/u_ddr3_clk_ibuf/diff_input_clk.u_ibufg_sys_clk (IBUFDS.O) is locked to AD12
	aquila_soc_i/mig_7series_0/u_aquila_soc_mig_7series_0_0_mig/u_iodelay_ctrl/clk_ref_mmcm_gen.mmcm_i (MMCME2_ADV.CLKIN1) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on MMCME2_ADV_X1Y0

REQP-1709#1 Warning
Clock output buffering  
PLLE2_ADV connectivity violation. The signal aquila_soc_i/mig_7series_0/u_aquila_soc_mig_7series_0_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/pll_clk3_out on the aquila_soc_i/mig_7series_0/u_aquila_soc_mig_7series_0_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i/CLKOUT3 pin of aquila_soc_i/mig_7series_0/u_aquila_soc_mig_7series_0_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i does not drive the same kind of BUFFER load as the other CLKOUT pins. Routing from the different buffer types will not be phase aligned.
Related violations: <none>

RTSTAT-10#1 Warning

10 net(s) have no routable loads. The problem bus(es) and/or net(s) are aquila_soc_i/axi_smc/inst/s00_nodes/s00_ar_node/inst/s_sc_areset, aquila_soc_i/axi_smc/inst/s00_nodes/s00_aw_node/inst/s_sc_areset, aquila_soc_i/axi_smc/inst/s00_nodes/s00_b_node/inst/s_sc_areset, aquila_soc_i/axi_smc/inst/s00_nodes/s00_r_node/inst/s_sc_areset, aquila_soc_i/axi_smc/inst/s00_nodes/s00_w_node/inst/s_sc_areset, aquila_soc_i/axi_smc/inst/s01_nodes/s01_ar_node/inst/s_sc_areset, aquila_soc_i/axi_smc/inst/s01_nodes/s01_aw_node/inst/s_sc_areset, aquila_soc_i/axi_smc/inst/s01_nodes/s01_b_node/inst/s_sc_areset, aquila_soc_i/axi_smc/inst/s01_nodes/s01_r_node/inst/s_sc_areset, aquila_soc_i/axi_smc/inst/s01_nodes/s01_w_node/inst/s_sc_areset.
